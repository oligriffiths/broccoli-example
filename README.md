# Broccoli Example App

So, what is this?

Well, broccoli docs are kinda confusing and there's not much info out
there so here's an attempt to clarify some of that.

## First things first

```
npm install -g broccoli-cli
```

Then from the project directory:

```
broccoli serve
```

To build your project into the `dest` directory, type:

```
broccoli build public
```
